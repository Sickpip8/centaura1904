CET_sc1:0 "The South Corvus Question"
CET_sc1_desc:0 "Since the invasion of Southern Corvus in 1880 we have held onto this territory as if we were occupying it. The question has arisen as to how we will incorporate the Southern Corvus territories in the future. If we cannot take care of such a priority it will hurt us in the long run."
CET_sc_int1:0 "For The Future"
CET_sc_int1_desc:0 "With our decision to integrate the Southern Corvus territories we must take several steps to insure that these territories truely feel at home in the Cetan Empire. We must learn on how to deal with the still lingering Corvun populations that were left behind back in 1880."
CET_sc_int2:0 "Incentivise Immigration"
CET_sc_int2_desc:0 "By incentivising immigration in Southern Corvus we can start growing fresh Cetan families within the newly sprung up coal mining towns. If we can keep our people well fed and on a stable job we can manage to grow the Cetan population in the area."
CET_sc_boomtown:0 "The Boomtowns"
CET_sc_boomtown_desc:0 "The coal mining industry has brought many people from all over the empire to look for work in Southern Corvus. Prominent towns such as Blackton have sprung up very recently and are helping to supply the growing need for coal in our industries back in Nauta."
CET_sc_assimilate:0 "Assimilate The Locals"
CET_sc_assimilate_desc:0 "Kicking out the Corvun population from their homeland would be a cruel thing to do, despite their incessant need to hinder our progress to assimilate them into our country. We will put more work into the education system and propaganda to ensure that South Corvuns will grow up to be Cetan."
CET_sc_deport:0 "Root Out Partisans"
CET_sc_deport_desc:0 "If the Corvuns cannot cooperate with us then they shall simply have to leave. By rejecting our efforts to integrate into our great nation they have struck us down time and time again, perhaps we should strike back and send them going back to where they really belong; The slums of Ravo."
CET_sc_new_industry:0 "New Industries"
CET_sc_new_industry_desc:0 "During the war of 1880 we invaded Southern Corvus with their rich coal mines, now we can finally put more of those to use with the growing need for military goods. As the industrialisation of Cetus keeps ramping up we will need to look for more oppertunities to build the weapons to protect ourselves against our neighbours."
CET_sc_policing:0 "Policing Efforts"
CET_sc_policiing_desc:0 "Not every Corvun is appreciating the new indoctrination that we are forcing on their children and go out on the streets to protest along with sabotaging the very coal mines that they work in. We will need to take stronger action against these criminal acts if we were to truely keep control of the region."
CET_sc_core:0 "Foreign No More"
CET_sc_core_desc:0 "After years of hard work, we have finally managed it. The Corvun population finally considers themselves Cetan or have left us in search of their old homelands. Corvus will surely be bitter about our achievement..."
CET_sc_railways:0 "Connect the Railways"
CET_sc_railways_desc:0 "In order to more efficiently transport the large amounts of coal coming from the Southern Corvus region, we must construct new railways to fullfill this demand. These rails will also give us the mobility to quickly amass our armies at the Corvun front."
CET_sc_occupy:0 "They Do Not Belong"
CET_sc_occupy_desc:0 "The invasion of 1880 was merely to support our economic troubles. The people who already lived in Southern Corvus do not belong with us here in Cetus. The occupation of Southern Corvus will continue so long we still hold onto it."
CET_sc_remove_debuff:0 "Resolve the Question"
CET_sc_remove_debuff_desc:0 "We have made it very clear as to what our intentions are for the Corvuns living in Cetus and we shall not waste any more of our time on debating this matter. Cetus is an empire, and we shall enact imperialistic behaviour on our subjects."
CET_sc_light_industry:0 "Light Industries"
CET_sc_light_industry_desc:0 "We should set up some lighter industries to keep the local populations from starving while they work at the coal mines all day long. A dead man can't mine any coal after all."
CET_sc_new_mines:0 "Open New Mines"
CET_sc_new_mines_desc:0 "Our decision to not make Southern Corvus our own was a conscious one, this region exists to support our industries at home, not for us to rely on their industries. Making way for more mines should help keep the homeland running smoothly."
CET_sc_heavy_industry:0 "Heavy Industries"
CET_sc_heavy_industry:0 "Spreading our industries across the country should help with the ongoing build of the military. The pesky partisans have been messing around, but once they see that were making the guns directly in their face they will surely consider better next time."
CET_sc_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
CET_sc_dockyards_desc:0 "Cetus has always been a nation that is proud of its navy and maritime prestige. In order to keep our role on the world stage as its greatest naval power we should increase our naval production."
CET_sc_partial_integration:0 "Allow For Freedoms"
CET_sc_partial_integration_desc:0 "With the intent to keep Southern Corvus for the time being it should be noted that the population is going to have to adapt to their new overlord. Maybe if allow for better freedoms within the region they will come to like us more."
#CET_sc_war_corvus:0 "Unite the Corvuses"
#CET_sc_war_corvus:0 "The time has come for us to continue our conquest of Corvus. While the lands are not as rich in resources as the once we've already taken, the people can still be put to work in our factories and armies. Their heretical way of thinking is going to come to an end."
CET_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
CET_status_quo_desc:0 "We have been a kingdom ever since the start of our great nation. We shall continue down this path."

With our narrowminded approach to policy in the area we are seeing problematic groups organise themselves in the area.

CET_cetus_rules_the_waves:0 "Cetus Rules the Waves"
CET_cetus_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "Cetus has always been nation to pride itself on its maritime history. Over the centuries the Cetan Navy has grown to be strongest on all of Forma. The quest to explore all of the Inanis is driving forward this expansion."
CET_independent_armed_forces:0 "Independently Acting Armed Forces"

SC_question:0 "The Southern Corvus Question"
SC_question_desc:0 "The question has arisen as to what to do with Southern Corvus for the remaining future, if not tackled this could lead to rising unrest."
