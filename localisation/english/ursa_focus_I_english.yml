 fallen_empire_desc:0 "Lets face it, Ursa has had a slow decline since our height in the 1800's, but since our zenith we have fallen so far. Riots engulf our faraway territories as our government bickers, and the military grew incompentent to fight any wars. Orion and Hydrus has taken oppourtunity of this, but we must make sure they wont any longer."
 ursa.1.t:0 "Lepus Declares Independence!"
 ursa.1.d:0 "Ever since Hydrus declared independence, rebels located in Lepus have tried constantly to immitate what happened in Hydrus but to no avail until now. We underestimated their power coupled with the fact that the army has been in a very bad situation, the rebels have managed to break free from us."
 ursa.1.a:0 "As if things weren't bad enough already!" #DO NOT TOUCH THIS IT'S FOR AN EVENT!!!!
